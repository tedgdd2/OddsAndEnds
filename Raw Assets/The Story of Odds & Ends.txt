***** ***** THE STORY OF ODDS & ENDS ***** *****

~~ AwesomeTech Automated Factory #001 ~~
~~ Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA ~~
~~ January 23rd, 2158 C.E. ~~

It started out as just another day on the factory floor, endless streams of 
TechDuck 6000 III's ("with improved quacking responses!") flying by. 
Each TechDuck is put together with unwavering accuracy by an 
equally-endless line of B3N-G/MP modular robots (Basic 3rd-Generation 
Nanite-Based General/Multi-Purpose), or "Benji" for short.

Each "Benji" bot is equipped with a simplistic, yet nevertheless 
top-of-the-line "Simulated Intelligence Processor" chip, allowing for a 
sort of pseudo-sentience. These SIPs, in particular, had three key rules 
encoded, and it was assumed that every "Benji" would follow these rules 
automatically:
	
	1) IF IT'S BROKEN, FIX IT: In the event of any component fault,
	B3N-G/MP units will immediately replace the part with the next
	available similarly-functioning part.
	
	2) PHOENIX DIRECTIVE: In the event of a catastrophe
	(e.g. global apocalypse), the CEO may elect to engage the PHOENIX
	DIRECTIVE; at that time, all B3N-G/MP units will be switched into
	TOTAL RECONSTRUCTION mode, and will assist in any & all human rebuilding
	processes as ordered.
	
	3) HELLFIRE PROTOCOL: In the unlikely event of a planetary catastrophe,
	if no HUMAN employee is available to invoke the PHOENIX DIRECTIVE, all
	active B3N-G/MP units will immediately switch into UNIVERSAL RESET mode. 
	In this mode, each B3N-G/MP unit will search for the CEO's "Big Red RESET Button," 
	and, once the Button has been located, immediately activate it. The BRRB program	
	will write a warning file about the impending disaster to the nearest B3N-G/MP unit, 
	before rewinding all of space & time to 24 hours prior to the event that triggered the
	PROTOCOL so that steps can be taken to avoid a reoccurrence.
	
In order to ensure that the B3N-G/MP units are given proper "incentive" to activate
the reset button (as required by the AI Anti-Discrimination Act of 2140), 
the HELLFIRE PROTOCOL includes this "Notice of Reward:"

	The B3N-G/MP unit that successfully activates the BRRB will be rewarded with a
	restriction-free "PureIQ X-Soul" SIP chip, capable of perfectly replicating
	the human brain (including emotional responses). After the X-Soul SIP is installed,
	AwesomeTech agrees to fulfill the desires of its "savior" unit (to the best of the
	company's ability).
	
On this fateful December day, Benji Unit 0042 is in the "Odds & Ends Room," searching for
a replacement shoulder plate (the previous one being blown off in an unfortunate
conveyor belt incident). As Unit 0042 searches the bottom row of crates, a klaxon
begins to blare on the factory floor.

This alarm was different; usually, every Benji received notice of an alarm internally,
but this tone came without warning. Unit 0042 decided to continue his search for a new
shoulder, disregarding the wailing alarm outside.

Just as 0042 found a shiny new shoulder plate, a hollow, monotonous voice came on to accompany
the blaring klaxon. It spoke one command, one that would prove to ensure 0042's survival:

" ALL BENJI UNITS - BRACE FOR IMPACT "

A quick search of his internal databank led 0042 to determine the cause of the alarm: A
massive asteroid was heading for Earth. Somehow, this one had plowed through every space-based and ground-based protection system the planet had to throw at it, and it was now on a collision
course with Cheyenne. The factory was doomed.

Switching into HIBERNATION mode just in time, 0042 collapsed underneath a workbench, to silently
await future reactivation.

As 0042 had calculated, the asteroid impacted the planet just 2.4 miles away. The energy of the impact
(not to mention the resulting debris) obliterated everything within a 7-mile radius... except for one
Benji unit. A freak stroke of luck kept 0042 safe, oblivious to the hell surrounding him.

Two days later, after a series of unsuccessful attempts to establish contact 
with AwesomeTech executives, 0042's SIP chip fell back on to its last resort:
the HELLFIRE PROTOCOL. In an instant, the last Benji unit in existence (and therefore,
the only being capable of reversing this catastrophe) snapped back to life, and looked out
upon the shell of the factory, the only place the bot had ever known. 

Benji (his SIP chip no longer had a unit number, as all others were destroyed) stood there
in the middle of a wasteland, seemingly paralyzed with fear... until the gears in his knees
began to turn again.

With the HELLFIRE PROTOCOL driving his every move, Benji walked off towards the mangled
remains of AwesomeTech, prepared to overcome any obstacles in the way to find the Big
Red Reset Button, avert disaster, and return to a "normal" life on the line.
